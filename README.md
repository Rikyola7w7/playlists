## Playlists program

A program to show playlists and also to play them :)

The reason why I started making this is so I can actually store a list of songs in a place where youtube or spotify can't remove songs from, locally. I know removing songs is not necessarily because these places want to remove them, sometimes it's the creators themselves. However, I believe youtube/spotify should notify you of such changes in your playlists, and definitely not what they do: "Unavailable videos are hidden"

As a side note, I deleted most of the work done in this project by accident so a lot of it is going to be redone in the first commits and the program used to be more complete. Most importantly, *this isnt the final name for this T-T.*

WARNING: This software is unfinished and subject to change, until any releases are made in github, it will most likely not be stable

## Usage

(I know this is ugly, it is subject to change and will change)

An example playlist file is given in the lists folder: "NCS.txt"

windows: run `playlists.exe playlist_file`
