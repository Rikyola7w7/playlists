[ ] Actual error messages
[ ] Improve parser to show errors
[ ] Different thing for active song and playing song, so I can check out info on a song that
    I'm not playing and if I go back to the playing song it doesn't start over
[ ] Automatic scroll down when getting to a song that is offscreen (maybe two before ?)
[x] Store the songs as []^SongData pointing to a []SongData array
[x] Store a file for session data
[x] Hot reloading

UI:
[x] UI to show the amount of song left as a bar
[x] UI for volume controls (slider + info)
[ ] UI for adding a song to the list
[ ] UI to randomize list order (call the ShuffleSongs proc)
[ ] UI to show the details of a song without playing it

UI rework:
[ ] UI colors T-T
[ ] Possibility for different color themes ?

[ ] Probably no way to do it in raylib, but try to find out if I can keep the music playing while moving/resizing the window ?
[ ] Icon (winows only ?)

Performance:
[x] Spall measurements
[ ] Thread pool for thread work, will do when more work on threads is required
[ ] ChangeLoadedMusicStream in a different thread so it doesn't stall (it sometimes does for a more than a frame)

Issues:
[ ] Wrong ui layout when moving from a one screen to another, only if the screens have different aspect ratio (?)

Not a priority:
[ ] UI to sort list order by various properties (artist, alphabetical, ...)
